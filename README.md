<h1> Preview </h1>

<h1> Usage </h1>

The current date and time is displayed in the header. The body section consists of blocks of business hours (9-5), and each block is colour coded according to the time; the past is grey, the present is green, and the future is blue. The user can select which block to input their tasks and click the save button. With access to local storage, the user is able to refresh/shut down the page and their input pertains. The user is able to clear all their inputs through the clear all button which clears the local storage, to which an alert popping up to understand that all content will be lost.

<h1> Extension ideas </h1>
<ul>
<li> Extend the time of calendar so a user is able to select the hours suitable to lifestyles outside of the given 9-5 </li>
<li> Have a separate table that lists urgent tasks/reminders/daily goals (similar to a planner) </li>
<li> possibly add a keyboard listener so instead of the user having to click save everytime, when the enter button is clicked it is added </li>
</ul>
